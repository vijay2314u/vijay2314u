Here's a brief explanation of the main components of the code:

1. `ball.py`: This file defines the `Ball` class that inherits from the `Turtle` class. It represents the ball in the Pong game and contains methods for moving, bouncing, and resetting the ball.

2. `paddle.py`: This file defines the `Paddle` class that also inherits from the `Turtle` class. It represents the paddles on both sides of the screen and contains methods for moving the paddles up and down.

3. `score_bord.py`: This file defines the `ScoreBoard` class that inherits from the `Turtle` class. It displays the score on the screen for both players.

4. `main.py`: This is the main file that brings everything together to create the Pong game. It sets up the game window, creates the paddles, ball, and scoreboards, handles user input for moving the paddles, and contains the game loop to control the ball movement and scoring.
